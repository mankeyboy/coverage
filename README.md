This code repository is for coverrage of a given environment with obstacles of known size, using Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation.
This subscribes the /obstacleList, and publishes the best positions according to the given environment on topic /coverage.

To run the code, prerequisites are :
* The swarm_simulator repository [1], should be set up on the system.

To run the code following commands (on separate terminals): <br />
$ roslaunch swarm_simulator swarm.launch <br />
$ rosrun swarm_simulator swarm_simulator_node <br />
$ rosrun swarm_coverage voronoi_main [number of agents]
